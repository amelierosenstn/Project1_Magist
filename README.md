# Project1_Magist
This project concerns Eniac, which is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. The company was founded in Spain but plans to expand to Brazil since it has an huge market with big growth opportunities. However, Eniac has no knowledge about the brazilian market and therefore needs a third party company that offers a centralized order management system. Here Magist comes into play. Only with help of such a service company a fast entry into the brazillian marfket is possible. Nevertheless, before signing a three year contract Eniac needs to analyse Magists database. Is Magist the right marketplace to offer such high-end tech products? 
And since fast deliveries are key to Eniac, are Magists deliveries fast enough?
